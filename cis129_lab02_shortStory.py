#This story is about my family rescuing our mini toy schnauzer.
print('The day was warm and sunny, and we were headed to an appointment for my brothers.')
#My mom, my brothers and I had some time to spare.
print('As we approached, something told us to stop by the dog pound and look around.')
#This is when we found our forever dog.
print('We saw a little grey dog with hair as grey as a stormy cloud, and she was shaking amongst her fellow dogs.')
#However we had to leave and come back after my brothers appointments.
print('A kind associate of the pound put our slip at the bottom of the pile of those requesting to rescue dogs.')
#We came back almost 3 hours later, hoping she would be there.
print('We came back for this dog hoping for her to still be there, and she was. The end.')
